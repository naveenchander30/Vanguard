# Spectrum Auditing & Telemetry Suite — Agent Context

## Project Overview
Self-hosted full-stack diagnostic app that audits office WiFi networks.
Correlates passive 802.11 RF data (Kismet) with active router state (SNMP) to visualize congestion and hardware load.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Fastify (TypeScript), Prisma (SQLite)
- **Frontend:** React (Vite), Cypress (E2E), Vitest (unit)
- **Package manager:** pnpm workspaces
- **Infra:** Docker Compose (Kismet + backend + frontend)

## Engineering Rules (IMMUTABLE)
1. **TDD is mandatory** — write tests BEFORE implementation code for every core function.
2. **Tests are immutable** — once written, tests must NOT be modified to pass. Implementation must conform to tests.
3. **Frequent commits** — commit after each passing test cycle with conventional commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `docs:`).
4. **Ask before big decisions** — architecture changes, new dependencies, schema changes must be discussed first.
5. **Keep tests meaningful** — unit tests for logic, integration for API, e2e for user flows.
6. **No test without assertion** — every test must have at least one explicit assertion.

## Data Flow
```
Kismet (REST API) ──> Backend Parser ──> Scoring Engine ──> SQLite ──> Frontend API
                                               ↑
SNMP (UDP 161) ──> Router Poller ──────────────┘
```

## Scoring Algorithm (0-100 Scale)
- External Interference: unrecognized BSSIDs penalized by RSSI (> -60 dBm = +20 pts)
- Internal Co-Channel: two internal APs on same ch hearing each other > -70 dBm → severe penalty
- Hardware Load: +1 pt per SNMP-reported client + weight for high CCA%
- Adjacent Interference: ACI rules for 2.4GHz (penalize ch 6 if ch 4,5,7,8 loud) + HT/VHT channel bonding in 5GHz

## Key Design Decisions
- Prisma with SQLite for zero-dependency local storage
- Fastify over Express for native TypeScript support and performance
- pnpm workspaces for monorepo management
- Kismet runs in host network mode for Wi-Fi adapter access

## Common Gotchas
- Kismet API returns huge payloads — always filter for `type: "Wi-Fi AP"` early
- SNMP OIDs differ by router vendor — use configurable OID mappings
- SQLite concurrent writes during active polling may need WAL mode

## Known Limitations

## Security Notes
- All API endpoints are currently unauthenticated by design for a self-hosted tool on a trusted network
- CORS is configured with `origin: true` which allows any origin — restrict this in production
- Deploy behind a reverse proxy with authentication for production use on untrusted networks
